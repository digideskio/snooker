If this position is occupied, it may move up to the next available position. Anytime the cue ball goes into a pocket, it must return to the "D".</p><h2>The Objective</h2><p>The goal of the game is to reach exactly <strong>31</strong> points before anyone else. However you must not go over 31 as this is a foul and your score is reset to zero. As the minimum number of points you can score in one round is 2, this means that if you reach 30, that is also a foul and your score is reset to zero.</p><h2>Scoring</h2><p>There are 3 ways to score points:</p><ol><li><strong>Cannon</strong> - Where the cue ball hits an object ball and continues on to hit a different ball</li><li><strong>Get a ball in</strong> - When an object ball goes into one of its designated pockets</li><li><strong>Go in off</strong> - When the cue ball rebounds off an object ball and goes into the rebounded balls pocket</li></ol><p>Each ball has an associated point value:</p><ul><li>A cannon = <strong>2 points</strong></li><li>Yellow ball = <strong>2 points</strong></li><li>Green ball = <strong>3 points</strong></li><li>Blue ball = <strong>5 points</strong></li><li>Pink ball = <strong>6 points</strong></li><li>Black ball = <strong>7 points</strong></li></ul><p>Only certain balls can score points using certain pockets:</p><ul><li><strong>The yellow and green balls</strong> may only go in (or in off) either of the corner pockets at the bottom of the table</li><li><strong>The blue ball</strong> may only go in (or in off) the side pockets</li><li><strong>The black ball</strong> may only go in (or in off) either of the corner pockets at the top of the table</li><li><strong>The pink ball</strong> may go in (or in off) any pocket</li><li><strong>The red ball</strong> must not go into any pocket, this is a foul and your score is reset to zero</li></ul><h2>Getting "Off the mark"</h2><p>While your score is on zero, you can not begin to score any points until you successfully <strong>cannon off the pink</strong> - this will result in 2 points and you may continue to score using any other method after that.</p><h2>Special balls</h2><p><strong>The brown ball</strong> (<em>aka the "poo ball"</em>) must not be touched at all. If this ball is moved or touched by any other ball, this is a foul - your score is reset to zero.</p><p><strong>The pink ball</strong> must result in a score. For example, hitting the cue ball into the pink ball and not scoring any points is a foul - your score is reset to zero. Hitting the cue ball into the pink ball, then the cue ball continues on to hit the green ball is a valid cannon - this is worth 2 points. Hitting the pink ball into any pocket (or going in off) is worth 6 points.</p><p><strong>The red ball</strong> can only be used to cannon onto. For example, hitting the cue ball into the green ball, then the cue ball continues on to hit the red ball is a valid cannon - this is worth 2 points. Hitting the cue ball into the red ball, then the cue ball continues on to hit the green ball is a foul - your score is reset to zero.</p><h2>Lifeline</h2><p>If you make the cue ball hit all four sides of the table without touching any other balls, you do not score but you are allowed to take another turn.</p><h2>Winners</h2><p>If you win and you go on to play another game, your target score is incremented by 10 points. For example, in the first game you reach exactly 31, in the next game you must reach 41 while the others players that have not won only need to get to 31.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12"><a href="#/" class="no-label btn btn-block btn-lg">Back</a></div></div>
